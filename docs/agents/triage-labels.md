# Triage Labels

The skills speak in terms of five canonical triage roles. This repo uses those exact strings
as Linear issue labels, created in the `Syreaz` team.

| Label in mattpocock/skills | Label in our tracker | Meaning                                  |
| --------------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `needs-triage`               | `needs-triage`         | Maintainer needs to evaluate this issue   |
| `needs-info`                 | `needs-info`           | Waiting on reporter for more information  |
| `ready-for-agent`            | `ready-for-agent`      | Fully specified, ready for an AFK agent   |
| `ready-for-human`            | `ready-for-human`      | Requires human implementation             |
| `wontfix`                    | `wontfix`              | Will not be actioned                      |

When a skill mentions a role (e.g. "apply the AFK-ready triage label"), use the corresponding
label string from this table via `save_issue`'s `labels` field.
